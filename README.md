<h1>Website Blocker</h1>

The python script will run as soon as your PC starts, and canhelp block certain websites during certain hours. For example - we could block social media sites during the working hours.

Windows, Mac and Linux have /etc/hosts file which can be used to block access to certain websites. For example in windows, the hosts file can be found here (C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts).

We will open this file using Python and add websites to be blocked. For example the said program will write the blocked social media websites to this hosts file from 8 AM to 6:30 PM based on local time of PC.
